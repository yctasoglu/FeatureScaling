# What is Feature Scaling

Feature Scaling or Standardization: It is a step of Data Pre Processing which is applied to independent variables or features of data. It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range. Sometimes, it also helps in speeding up the calculations in an algorithm.

One of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature scaling. With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms donâ€™t perform well when the input numerical attributes have very different scales.
